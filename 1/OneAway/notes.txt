s1 = first string,      s2 = second string
could generate all the strings one edit away and then check that that list contains s2
    This is surely not the best option

Maybe something works where we remove all the characters that match up and check the difference
Maybe some sort of bit operation that zeros out the characters that match already.

iterate through shorter string until first character that doesn't match
    if string lengths are the same:
        iterate through the rest, if any don't match return false, else true
    skip the non matching character in the longer string and compare the rest of the strings

    should be O(n) since you only iterate through once
