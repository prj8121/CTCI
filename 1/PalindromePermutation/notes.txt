If I were doing this manually I would check that there was only one character with an odd frequency

idea 1
    iterate through counting character frequency in a hashmap
    check that exactly one of the frequencies is odd

    This is O(n) because you go through linearly twice, once when counting, once when checking

    I'm not seeing a way to do much better than this


Realized that there can be 0 character with odd frequency if the length is even
