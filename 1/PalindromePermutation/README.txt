Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word of phrase that is the same fowards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words. You can ignore casing and non-letter characters.

EXAMPLE
Input:	Tact coa
Output:	True (permutations: "tacocat", "atco cta", etc.)
