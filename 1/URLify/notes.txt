idea 1
    iterate through the string and build a new one as you go, when you hit a space place the %20.
    when you run out of space all that should remain in the string are the trailing spaces
    This is not inplace but is O(n)

idea 2
    iterate through, when space is found copy the whole remainder of the string down to make space for %20

    copying the string will yeild pretty bad runtime.

idea 3
    iterate through backwards, 
    this way the trialing spaces in the input will create buffer enough that
     you can replace the spaces with %20 inplace without losing info

     O(n)
